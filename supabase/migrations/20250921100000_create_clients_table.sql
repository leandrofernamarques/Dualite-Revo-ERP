/*
          # [Operation Name]
          Create Clients Table and Policies

          ## Query Description: "This operation creates the 'clients' table to store customer information and enables Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure users can only access their own data. It also sets up a unique constraint for email per user and adds indexes for performance. No existing data will be affected as this is an initial setup."
          
          ## Metadata:
          - Schema-Category: "Structural"
          - Impact-Level: "Low"
          - Requires-Backup: false
          - Reversible: true
          
          ## Structure Details:
          - Table: public.clients
          - Columns: id, user_id, name, email, phone, created_at, deleted_at
          - Indexes: idx_clients_user_id_name, idx_clients_user_id_email
          - Constraints: clients_pkey, unique_user_email
          
          ## Security Implications:
          - RLS Status: Enabled
          - Policy Changes: Yes (owner-only policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
          - Auth Requirements: Requires authenticated user (auth.uid())
          
          ## Performance Impact:
          - Indexes: Added (improves query performance on user_id, name, and email)
          - Triggers: None
          - Estimated Impact: Low performance impact on writes, significant improvement on reads.

-- 1. Create the clients table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.clients (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name text NOT NULL,
  email text NOT NULL,
  phone text,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  deleted_at timestamptz
);

-- 2. Add comments to the table and columns
COMMENT ON TABLE public.clients IS 'Stores client information for each user.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.clients.user_id IS 'Owner of the client record.';

-- 3. Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_clients_user_id_created_at ON public.clients (user_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_clients_name_trgm ON public.clients USING gin (name gin_trgm_ops);


-- 4. Add unique constraint for email per user
ALTER TABLE public.clients
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_user_email UNIQUE (user_id, email);

-- 5. Enable Row-Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE public.clients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 6. Create RLS policies
-- Policy for SELECT: Users can only see their own clients that are not soft-deleted.
CREATE POLICY "Allow select for owner"
ON public.clients
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND deleted_at IS NULL);

-- Policy for INSERT: Users can only insert clients for themselves.
CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for owner"
ON public.clients
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy for UPDATE: Users can only update their own clients.
CREATE POLICY "Allow update for owner"
ON public.clients
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy for DELETE: Users can only soft-delete their own clients.
-- Note: We are using soft-delete, so a real DELETE is not expected.
-- This policy is for safety. A real delete would use a similar policy.
CREATE POLICY "Allow delete for owner"
ON public.clients
FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
